# Where Is My Bus

ABOUT THE PROJECT

   There are buses made available for passengers travelling distances, but not
many passengers have complete information about these buses. This project proposes an
android mobile phone application that gives complete information namely the number of
bases that go to the required destination, bus number, bus timing ,the route through which the
bus would pass, time taken for the bus to reach ,maps that would guide the passenger with
his/her route and most importantly, track the current location of the bus and give the correct
time for the bus to reach its bus stop.

The aim of this project is to overcome the problem stated above. The system
is an android application that gives necessary information about all the travelling buses. This
information overcomes the problems faced in the previously built application. The platform
chosen for this kind of system is android. Android is user friendly platform, thereby enabling
ease of access for all the users.


# The Project Consists of 3 main apps

1. Admin App: 

   The admin manages the database. Admin has the power to view the
database which includes all the bus details and routes rates and time. Admin can also
add/delete information about a bus. Admin needs to login to the admin app in order to get
access to the admin console. In their they can add bus details and add stop details.

2. User:

   Here the user is a gust user; the person who is using the app does not have
to Register/login. The user can launch the app and use it. In the home section user can enter
the origin, the origin can be their current or custom given location, and also a destination
where they have to go and the user can see all the available bus to that location with the
fastest and cheapest bus showing on the top of the list, when the user selects a bus the apps
will show the selected bussâ€™s live/approximate location. Also, there is feature called the trip
planner where the user can set multiple stops/destination and the app will show the user a set
of bus which the user has to take, with total cost of bus and individual fair of the bus.

3. Driver:

   Here driver can be the bus driver or conductor. The purpose of the driver is to
provide the bus location. The driver app will grab the bus current location using GPS. The
driver does not need to login/register. When the driver opens the app, he/she is prompted to
enter the bus number. The app identifies the bus number form the database and updates its bus
location on the database. The user app fetches the bus location from the database.
